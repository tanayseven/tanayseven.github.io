Hi, I'm Tanay Prabhu Desai, and I'm a software engineering consultant. I solve most programming problems using Python,
but I'm open to almost any language. I love technology and programming and spend quite a bit of my free time doing that.

I have 5 years of experience building professional software. I have an intermediate level of experience. This is either
true or I'm a victim of the imposter syndrome else I'm just procrastinating to update this. I have a huge inclination
toward collaborative working and pair programming.

By reading these blogs you'll get to know the different experiments that I do to improve my professional life as a
Software Engineer. These are some lessons that I've learned from my colleagues both seniors and juniors as well as
peers.

Most of my experience till today has been building software that follows good practices in terms of architecture,
design, code, and tests. Apart from that, I have experience in programming amateur video games, playing around in my
personal Arch Linux installation.

Being passionate from a very young age about technology I was always more of a tinkerer myself. Always had the grit to
learn to program and to build and tinker with the software myself. This enabled me to accelerate my growth in the field
of software.

Early in my career So I had the privilege to work with really talented and smart folks who were experts and evangelists
in good software practices and agile. As a consultant, I'm focused on writing about how I apply those concepts and
values in everyday software.

Enjoy reading my blog and feel free to like, comment and discuss on the posts.
